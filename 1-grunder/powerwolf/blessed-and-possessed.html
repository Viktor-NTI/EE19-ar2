    <h1>Blessed & Possessed</h1>
    <p>Benedictus <br>
        Et affectus <br>
        Benedictus <br>
        Halleluja</p>
    <p>Warfare, pain and murder <br>
        In Golgotha we stand <br>
        For the last rite of heaven <br>
        The seventh sacrament</p>
    <p>Born of blood and fire <br>
        And blessed by midnight's hand <br>
        In the core of the pyre <br>
        No sorrow we repent</p>
    <p>And we ride by the storm <br>
        In the night we're reborn <br>
        And we carry our hearts to the dome <br>
        To the bible we're sworn <br>
        In the dark we transform <br>
        And we die <br>
        By the dawn all alone</p>
    <p>In the night we can't rest <br>
        In the dark we are blessed <br>
        And in moonlight we fight for the father <br>
        We are brave to the heart <br>
        Blood and fire we part <br>
        And forever we pray for we are</p>
    <p>Blessed and possessed</p>
    <p>Cursed by our desire <br>
        And guided by our lust <br>
        Holy father in heaven <br>
        In sacristy we trust</p>
    <p>Blessed before the altar <br>
        No life in celibate <br>
        For the call of the wicked <br>
        The wicked we await</p>
    <p>And we die by the sword <br>
        Undead life our reward <br>
        And we carry our lust all alone <br>
        To the bible we're sworn <br>
        In desire transform <br>
        We're not blessed <br>
        When undressed to the bone</p>
    <p>In the night we can't rest <br>
        In the dark we are blessed <br>
        And in moonlight we fight for the father <br>
        We are brave to the heart <br>
        Blood and fire we part <br>
        And forever we pray for we are</p>
    <p>Blessed and possessed</p>
