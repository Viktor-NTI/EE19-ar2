        <p>"There isn't a game out there that comes close to the tension and fear experienced in Visage. I've played a couple chapters already and it's absolutely terrifying!"</p>
        <p>"Got me to be afraid of the dark again. 10/10"</p>
        <p>"I've screamed but kept playing... I couldn't stop playing... I had to see what was around that next door... or that next corridor! For me, that's a sign of a Masterpiece!"</p>
