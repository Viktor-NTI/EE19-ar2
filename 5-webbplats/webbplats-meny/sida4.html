    <p>Franck Hueso, better known by his stage name Carpenter Brut, is a French synthwave artist from Poitiers, France.[citation needed] Little personal information is known about him aside from his French origin. His anonymity is a deliberate artistic choice in order to place more importance on the music itself rather than the identity of the musician behind it. Hueso started writing music as Carpenter Brut with the intention of mixing sounds from horror films, metal, rock, and electronic music.</p>
    <p>Carpenter Brut has released three EPs, EP I (2012), EP II (2013) and EP III (2015) which were collected and released together as the album Trilogy (2015). He has released two additional studio albums, Leather Teeth (2018) and Blood Machines OST (2020), along with one live album, CARPENTERBRUTLIVE (2017). He has also contributed original music to a variety of soundtracks, both for film and video games.</p>
    <p>In live performances Carpenter Brut is joined on stage by guitarist Adrien Grousset and drummer Florent Marcadet, both from the French metal band Hacride and in 2016 Brut toured the United States with the Swedish heavy metal band Ghost. In a 2018 interview with Loudwire, Tobias Forge, lead singer of the band Ghost, stated that Hueso was also the producer for the band Deathspell Omega, a French black metal band known for the anonymity of its members.</p>
